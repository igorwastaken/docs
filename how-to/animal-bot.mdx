## Project Structure
Your project structure will be straightforward and organized as follows:

```
my-bot/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── commands/
│       ├── fun/
│       │   ├── cat.ts
│       │   ├── dog.ts
│       │   └── capy.ts
│       └── util/
│           └── ping.ts
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

## Creating Commands
To create a command, first set up the `fun` folder and the `cat.ts` file. Add the following code to `cat.ts`:

```ts
import { CommandType } from '@oncordjs/client';
import { CommandInteraction } from 'discord.js';

const command: CommandType = {
    data: {
        name: 'cat',
        description: 'Meow!'
    },
    execute: async (interaction: CommandInteraction) => {
        const { image, fact } = await interaction.client.animality.get("cat");

        await interaction.reply({
            content: fact,
            files: [
                {
                    attachment: image,
                    name: 'cat.png'
                }
            ]
        });
    }
};

export default command;
```

### Code Explanation
This code utilizes the [Animality](https://animality.xyz) API to fetch and display a random cat image and fact. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

- Defines a new command with the name `cat` and the description `Meow!`.
- Uses the `execute` function to fetch data from the Animality API when the command is triggered.
- Replies to the interaction with a cat fact and image.
