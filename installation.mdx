## Using the CLI (for TypeScript)

We've simplified bot creation with a single command. Follow these steps to install:

1. Install the CLI globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @oncordjs/generate
    ```

2. Create a new project:
    ```bash
    create-oncord-project my-project-name
    ```

This will generate a new directory called `my-project-name` with the necessary files and structure for your Oncord bot.

3. Navigate to your project directory:
    ```bash
    cd my-project-name
    ```

Your project is now set up and ready for development. Follow the steps in the documentation to start building your Discord bot with `@oncordjs/client`.

## Using JavaScript

Creating a bot in JavaScript is also straightforward.

1. Set up your project environment:
    ```bash
    mkdir my-project-name
    cd my-project-name
    npm init -y
    ```

This will create a new folder called `my-project-name`.

2. Create an `index.js` file:
    ```bash
    touch index.js
    ```

You can use IDEs like [Visual Studio Code](https://vscode.dev/) to edit the file.

3. Add the following code to `index.js`:
    ```js
    const { Gateway } = require('@oncordjs/client');

    const client = new Gateway({
        token: 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN',
        intents: ['Guilds']
    });

    client.handleCommands(__dirname + '/commands', '.js');

    client.login();
    ```

4. Create a folder for your commands:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p commands/util
    ```

Your project structure should look like this:
```
my-project-name/
├── index.js
├── commands/
│   └── util/
│       └── ping.js
└── package.json
```

Your JavaScript bot setup is now complete. Refer to the documentation for further instructions on building and customizing your bot.
