## Bot Token Security

It's crucial to keep your bot token secure. Exposing your token can lead to severe issues such as hacking and unauthorized access to your bot account. This exposure can even result in the suspension of your Discord account. For more information on securing your token, read this [Discord.js article](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/#using-environment-variables) on how to prevent token leaks.
